# DevOps Building Blocks

Let's look at how the infrastructure, CI/CD, architecture evolved over time.

---

# Infrastructure 
Cloud, Container Orchestration, ...
<br>
The mid-2000s saw the advent of a new paradigm in computing: “the cloud" with on demand self service and rapid elasticity.

--

.left[
* 2001 - VMWare releases for server market
* 2005 - Release of IaC config management tool Puppet (Chef 2009, Ansible 2012, Terraform 2014)
* 2006 - Amazon launches Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* 2013 - Docker
* 2014 - Google introduces Kubernetes based on experience gained through Borg and other internal Google systems
* 2015 - Google publishes the Borg Paper (https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43438)

# Architecture

--

.left[
* 2011 - A workshop of software architects held near Venice in May 2011 used the term "microservice" to describe what the participants saw as a common architectural style that many of them had been recently exploring.
* 2011 - Adam Wiggins published the Twelce-Factor App methodology for building software-as-a-service (https://12factor.net/).
* 2015 - Around 2015, serverless architecture comes into being.
* 2015 - Cloud Native Computing Foundation is founded.
* 2016 - Reactive Manifesto (https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)

# Way of Working

--

.left[
* 1985 - GNU manifesto and the Free Software Foundation is launched
* 1990s - Two Pizza Team (Bezos, Amazon)
* 1998 - JUnit (based on SUnit which was written 1994)
* 1999 - CI was first written in Kent Beck's Extreme Programming book (http://tiny.cc/7sycfz)
* 2001 - Agile Manifesto (https://agilemanifesto.org/)
* 2010 - Jez Humble and David Farley published Continuous Delivery book (http://tiny.cc/poycfz)
* 2016 - Google publishes SRE book
* 2017 - Weaveworks introduces term GitOps

# Changes in Mindset

--
.left[
From:
* "Scale Up" >> get a bigger 'computer'
* Monolith will well-defined layers >> each layer owned by an expert team
* Design for Stability
]

.left[
To:
* "Scale Out" >> get more 'computers'
* Break transactions into services >> each service owned by a “two pizza” team
* Failures will happen >> design for resilience

# DevOps

--

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organisation’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.

--

DevOps represents a change in IT culture, focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach.

--

DevOps emphasises people (and culture), and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams.

--

DevOps implementations utilise technology — especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective.

# SRE - Site Reliability Engineering

--

SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team.
<br><br>
One could view SRE as a specific implementation of DevOps with some extensions.

# SRE

.left[
*	At Google, independent function maintaining large product systems.
* Software engineers think and act as SRE until it is beyond their scale.
*	Defines, builds and evolves best practices, standards and tool sets to improve availability, performance and operational efficiency

# IaC - Infrastructure as Code

--

.left[
* Template code should be in a repo
* Track issues and history
* Hook into CI/CD pipelines
]

# IaC - Imperative and Declarative Approaches 
.left[
* Imperative - also known as “procedural,” this is an approach where commands desired to produce a state are defined and executed. Examples: Chef and Ansible 
* Declarative - also known as “functional,” this is an approach where you define a desired state and the tool converges the existing system on the model. Examples: AWS CloudFormation and TerraForm
