# DevOps Building Blocks

Let's look at how the infrastructure, CI/CD, architecture evolved over time.

---

# Infrastructure 
Cloud, Container Orchestration, ...
<br>
The mid-2000s saw the advent of a new paradigm in computing: “the cloud" with on demand self service and rapid elasticity.

.left[
* 2001 - VMWare releases for server market
* 2005 - Release of IaC config management tool Puppet (Chef 2009, Ansible 2012, Terraform 2014)
* 2006 - Amazon launches Elastic Compute Cloud (**EC2**)
* 2013 - **Docker**
* 2014 - Google introduces **Kubernetes** based on experience gained through Borg and other internal Google systems
* 2015 - Google publishes the **Borg** Paper (https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43438)
]

# Architecture

--

.left[
* 2011 - A workshop of software architects held near Venice in May 2011 used the term "**microservice**" to describe what the participants saw as a common architectural style that many of them had been recently exploring.
* 2011 - Adam Wiggins published the Twelve-Factor App methodology for building software-as-a-service (https://12factor.net/).
* 2015 - Around 2015, **serverless** architecture comes into being.
* 2015 - Cloud Native Computing Foundation is founded.
* 2016 - Reactive Manifesto (https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)

# Way of Working

.left[
* 1985 - GNU manifesto and the Free Software Foundation is launched
* 1990s - Two Pizza Team (Bezos, Amazon)
* 1999 - CI was first written in Kent Beck's Extreme Programming book (http://tiny.cc/7sycfz)
* 2001 - **Agile Manifesto** (https://agilemanifesto.org/)
* 2010 - Jez Humble and David Farley published **Continuous Delivery** book (http://tiny.cc/poycfz)
* 2016 - Google publishes **SRE** book
* 2017 - Weaveworks introduces term GitOps

# Changes in Mindset

--
.left[
## From:
* "**Scale Up**" >> *get a bigger 'computer'*
* Monolith will well-defined layers >> *each layer owned by an expert team*
* Design for Stability
]

--
.left[
## To:
* "**Scale Out**" >> *get more 'computers'*
* Break transactions into services >> *each service owned by a “two pizza” team*
* Failures will happen >> *design for resilience*

# DevOps

--

DevOps represents a change in IT culture, focusing on rapid IT service delivery through the adoption of agile, lean practices in the context of a system-oriented approach.

--

DevOps emphasises people (and culture), and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams.

--

DevOps implementations utilise technology — especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective.

# DevOps Core Values: The Three Ways

1.	Systems Thinking
2.	Amplifying Feedback Loops
3.	A Culture of Continuous Experimentation and Learning

# Key DevOps Methodologies

# SRE - Site Reliability Engineering

--

SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team.
<br><br>
One could view SRE as a specific implementation of DevOps with some extensions.

---
template: inverse

# SRE

.left[
*	At Google, independent function maintaining large product systems.
* Software engineers think and act as SRE until it is beyond their scale.
*	Defines, builds and evolves best practices, standards and tool sets to improve availability, performance and operational efficiency

# IaC - Infrastructure as Code

.left[
* Template code should be in a repo
* Track issues and history
* Hook into CI/CD pipelines

# IaC - Imperative and Declarative Approaches 
.left[
## Imperative
Also known as “*procedural*,” this is an approach where commands desired to produce a state are defined and executed.
<br>
Examples: Chef and Ansible 
## Declarative
Also known as “*functional*,” this is an approach where you define a desired state and the tool converges the existing system on the model.
<br>
Examples: AWS CloudFormation and TerraForm

# Deployment Strategies
.left[
**Progressive Delivery** is Continuous Delivery with fine-grained control over the 'blast radius':
* immutable build artifacts
* incremental release
* observability
* fail fast

# GitOps

--

GitOps is a standardized workflow for how to deploy, configure, monitor, update and manage infrastructure-as-code

---
template: inverse
# GitOps
**Git repository as single source of truth**, containing also **declarative** descriptions of the infrastructure desired in the production environment and an automated process to make production match the described state in the repository.

---
template: inverse
# GitOps

<br><br>
## From: imperative usage - 'kubectl'
<br><br>
## To: declarative usage - yaml files

# GitOps Exercise

.left[
* Install the Flux deployment agent in the cluster.
* Add the agent key to our repository, so that it can read and write the configuration.
* Configure the agent to watch to our repository.
* The agent noticed some manifests in the repository, and automatically applied them.
* Kubernetes deployes the manifests.
