# What is Continuous Delivery?

--

keep it clean, ready to deploy

--

The ability to get changes (features, config changes, bug fixes) into production safely, quickly, and in a sustainable way.

---

# Why CI & CD?

--

<br>make releases painless, low risk events
<br>reduce time to market
<br>increase software quality
<br>increase customer satisfaction

# CI & CD Principles 

--

<br>automated deployment pipeline
<br>everyone commits to mainline every day
<br>build quality in
<br>work in small batches
<br>everyone is responsible

---
template: inverse
# Pipeline
      
--
      
an automated, repeatable set of processes chained together to transform source code into a deployable product

---
template: inverse
# Continuous Integration

--

Integrate code into a shared repository which starts the pipeline.
      
The process of automatically detecting, getting, and building updates as source code or configuration is changed for a product.

# Continuous Delivery

--

The ability to produce deployable products quickly, reliably, and consistently through automated processes responding to code or configuration changes.
  
---
template: inverse
# Continuous Deployment

--

The whole pipeline - including releasing on production - is automated.

# How to measure benefits?

--

<br>lead time for changes
<br>release frequency
<br>time to restore service
<br>change failure rate

# GitOps
      
--
      
Git is the only source of truth. 
      
GitOps requires the whole desired state of the system to be stored in version control.
      
GitOps still promotes immutable infrastructure as best practice, i.e. immutable container images. But with declarative configuration (stored in Git), the system can be then parametrized.
